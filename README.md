# MyJarvis

1. It is a Virtual assistant purely made in Python and it has some additional features over other virtual assistants for instance if you will ask Google assistant to switch off your Device it will not be able to but when you will ask this MyJarvis to shut down your PC it will do it for you.

2. As of now I have used Windows commands to open files and to shut down PC and to perform similar actions but it can be modified by adding commands for linux and android which will make it platform Independent.

3. If you will ask MyJarvis who made you it will say My name that is Saurabh, you can ask it to open google,facebook.amazon,flipkart,snapdeal,music,videos,etc. It will do it for you and you can even ask it to calculate I mean any number and any operation it will do it for you, You can ask it the time,date and day and even about any celebrity it will search on wikipedia and speak something about the celebrity.If there is something it isnt taught or coded for then it will search that thing on Internet.

4. You can add unlimited commands in it, It has no limit like humans to learn Things.

Happy Reading.
