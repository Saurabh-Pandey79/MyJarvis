# MyJarvis
It is a Virtual assistant purely made in Python and it has some additional features over other virtual assistants as if you will ask Google assistant to switch off your Device it
will not be able to but when you will ask this Jarvic to shut down your PC it will do it for you.
As of now I have used Windows commands to open files and to shut down PC and to perform similar actions but it can be modified by adding commands for linux and android which will
make it platform Independent.
You can add unlimited commands in it, It has no limit like humans to learn Things.
Happy Reading.
